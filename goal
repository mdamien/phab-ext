GOAL
===
mark all as read in one click
synchronize all tabs notification count



when to start/stop ? do I force one phabricator tab to be open ? (would be a good option)
use the socket/notifcation of phabricator
do not duplicate desktop notif
   wait if there's already a deduplication of desktop notif, why can't i do the same thing with normal notifs ?

having it on a tab is less intrusive, I can also just silence all the other tabs
